# PriorityQueue
Priority Queues are an abstract data structure that implement heaps to remove either the largest, or smallest, value in O(nlogn) time without sorting the entire collection. I use priority queues to demonstrate that a shortest job first queuing algorithm is superior to first in first out and round robin.
